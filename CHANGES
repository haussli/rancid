	clogin patch (courtesy stephen stuart); does two things:

	- adds a "-x" switch that takes lines from a file and does the same
	thing as if you'd specified ;-separated commands with -c (newline
	separates commands).  thanks to stephen stuart.

	- does a subst on commands in run_commands so that expansion of
	escapes is performed; e.g. you can say "copy rcp://blah slot0:\r" to
	answer the question that comes after the copy command.
