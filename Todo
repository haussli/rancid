- add user-specific post-filter option per-device-type to filter output before
  diff (thus affecting mail and commit).
- allow -r to be specified multiple times for rancid-run/control_rancid
- add description of the data path/process of a rancid script
- add configure option to force the location of perl
- would like router cmd-line timestamps based on login.  suggest .cloginrc
  knob for pre-cmd ("post-login"), pre-interactive-cmd ("post-interactive-
  login"), and the like.  it would need to be per-mfg, ie: either know the
  mfg of the device or assume it from the *login cmd used.  eg:

        add pre-cmd *   term monitor
        add pre-cmd-ios *       term monitor
    -i option
- it would be useful to log commands that are permission denied rather than
  just failing.  it was mentioned on cisco-isp list.
- login script should catch output to stdout/user, so that if the rancid script
  exits prematurely, such as due to a cmd authorization failure, the user
  doesnt get a tcl traceback
  See http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TclCmd/catch.htm
  - related; could also add an error msg for required command like write term
    in the authorization failure case:
	return(-1) if (/command authorization failed/i);
- '% clogin clogin' w/ ssh default produces a tcl traceback
- RSP440 show version info is missing, eg:
  !Chassis type: ASR9K Series - a ASR9K Series router
- sup2t show version info is missing
- cpu info missing from sup-2t

- rivlogin is a mess
- lg.conf(5) needs the query stuff documented.
- could the cloginrc match function do a longest-match search instead of
  first match?
- look at Andreas Dahl's Brocade switch collection scripts
- noenable should handle a value properly.  i.e.: 1 == noenable, 0 == enable or
  perhaps don't clear the -noenable cmd-line option.  the manpage needs to be
  fixed as well.  see msg from fred jordan.
- recent hp procurve s/w does not seem have show flash or show module
- would like to have a "pre-login-sequence" cloginrc directive, see
  rancid-disuss message from mike ethridge 16/may
- would like to have a "login_option" cloginrc directive to specify arbitrary
  command-line options
- possibly a "debug" (exp_internal 1 ?) cloginrc directive?  *login -d flag
  for same?  warning about filling logs?
- on 6500, show boot and show bootvar produce the same output and both appear
  in the crunched config.  should one be filtered?
- isis filtering for foundry?
- hlogin hangs when the procurve does not ask for passwords
- share/ tool to prune cvs versions, excluding those with tags, by (all but
  latest | keep N versions | keep N days/months/years)
- extreme collection fails for tacacs-enabled boxen due to diffs in UI - blech!
- FILTER_PWDS knob is not implemented in alteon, bay, ezt3 or redback due to
  lack of h/w to test against.  need help from the community.
- should par's -c override an input files' : cmd?
- should *login emmit "clogin error:" or "*login error:" to make matches for
  login failures definitive?
- would like hpuifilter to be more friendly to interactive logins
- rancid with zebra via vtysh?
- rancid for unix?
- would be nice if it were possible to add additional commands to be run
  per-platform as a user desires.  how could the user also provide a
  filtering routine?
- a format such as {<user>} as the pwd in .cloginrc to indicate *login should
  prompt the user for the password
- implement the bits marked unimplemented in lg.conf
- detect 'same' vty configs
	- ignoring length/width/passwd is a start, but need more
- merge clogin and jlogin (or *login !!) into one.  possible?
- flogin needs to be fixed for the userpasswd bug seen in jlogin 1.17, but
  this is clouded by the UI mess.
- LG should sort routers
- LG {requested} command additions
	- show controllers T3 (data)
	- handle redback in the looking glass
	- show ip as-path-access-list
	- show access-list
	- show ip community-list
	- show ip route-map
- should we add CVS ID header to saved configs?  configurable option? - idea

- Why does nlogin use a gratuitiously different variable name for the device(s)
  in the main loop?
