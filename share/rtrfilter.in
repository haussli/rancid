# rtrtfilter - "| rtrfilter -x <perl regex> -i <perl regex> -f <regex file> \
#	-u <From address> -s <subject> <rcpts>"
#	expects to read an email message on stdin containing a diff from
# rancid and emails a filtered copy to <rcpts> with the subject of the
# original msg or the contents of -s <subject>.  the perl regex(es) specified
# via -x or -i (exclusive and inclusive, respectively) are applied to the
# router names (i.e.: files) from the "Index:" of the diff o/p.  alternatively,
# the regex's may be specified in -f <regex file> in the form:
#	# comment
#	x <regex>
#	# comment
#	i <regex>
# do not include /'s in the regex's.
# e.g.:
#	#i	inc1
#	i	a0[12]\.
#	i	a0[34]\.
#	# comment
#	x router\.db
#	x ^r0[0-9]
#	#i foo
#
# exclusion takes precedence and defaults to nothing.  inclusion defaults to
# everything.
#
# this program requires the Mail::Mailer module which can be found on CPAN.
